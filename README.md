# ED-Core

#About

Contains common code that is used between a number of my mod projects. This mod itself will not do anything without another of the mods enabled.


#Change Log

2.0.0.0
 * Inital Release
 * Yes the version numbering does just start at 2.0.0.0, thanks for noticing
 * This was done because I decided that all of my 1.1 mods would have the version upped to 2
